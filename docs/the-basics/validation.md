# Validation

## Introduction

Vania provides several different approaches to validate your application's incoming data. It is most common to use the validate method available on all incoming HTTP requests. However, we will discuss other approaches to validation as well.

Vania includes a wide variety of convenient validation rules that you may apply to data, even providing the ability to validate if values are unique in a given database table. We'll cover each of these validation rules in detail so that you are familiar with all of Laravel's validation features.
